All Onsite Contestants must confirm their attendance at the onsite event no later than the date specified in the TCO Rules. In order to confirm attendance, Onsite Contestants must have acquired any necessary travel visas and confirm their ability to travel to the United States no later than the date specified in the TCO Rules. If an Onsite Contestant is required to travel from outside the United States, the Onsite Contestant must show proof of a visa and/or passport by the date specified in the TCO Rules. Onsite Contestants may email a copy of their documents as instructed in the TCO Rules. Onsite Contestants who fail to meet this requirement may be replaced as an Onsite Contestant.

By applying for a visa to attend the TCO, Contestant understands that topcoder will cooperate with all requests by consulates, the Department of Homeland Security, and law enforcement in connection with such Contestant's visa, including information about the visa applicants' attendance at the TCO.
