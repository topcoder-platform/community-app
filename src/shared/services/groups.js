/**
 * Service for communication with group-related part of Topcoder API.
 *
 * NOTE: Through this file, and in related contexts, by loading a user group,
 * or user groups data, we refer to loading the information about descendant
 * user groups; i.e. given some user group(s) we speak about loading the sub-
 * three of related child groups.
 *
 * By group maps we refer to the object having group IDs as the keys, and
 * group data objects as the values. Any group object included into a group map
 * has its "subGroups" array (if present) replaced by "subGroupIds", that lists
 * only the IDs of immediate child groups; actual child group objects from
 * "subGroups" are recursively added to the top level of the group map.
 * Also each group in the group map is timestamped to keep caching of
 * the loaded data.
