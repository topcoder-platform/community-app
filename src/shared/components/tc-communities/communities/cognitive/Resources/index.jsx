Cognitive Points
              </h3>
              <p>
                Every educational Cognitive challenge gives you an opportunity
                to earn Cognitive Points. Note that you can only earn Cognitive
                Points once for every educational challenge and paid challenges
                tagged with “IBM Cognitive” or “IBM Watson”.
              </p>
              <p>
                All successful submissions for the educational / fun challenges
                will be awarded 500 cognitive points.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may also earn Cognitive points by competing in prize-backed
                challenges that are tagged with “IBM Cognitive” or
                “IBM Watson&rdquo;. The placement you earn in these challenges
                (non-F2F)
                will determine how many Cognitive points will be added to your

Cognitive Leaderboard and Prize Schedule
              </h3>
              <p>
                All Cognitive Points earned between January 2018 and August 31,
                2018 are eligible for the TCO18 trip. All challenges that start
                in August 2018 are counted.
              </p>
              <p>
                After August 2018, the leaderboard will reset. All Cognitive
                Points earned between September 2018 and August 31, 2019 are
                eligible for the TCO19 trip prize.

TCO Trip Prizes
              </h3>
              <p>
                The Topcoder Cognitive Community member with the most
                leaderboard points (on the “All” Leaderboard) at the conclusion
                of each prize period will win an all-expenses paid trip to the
                Topcoder Open, including airfare, lodging, ground
                transportation, and certain meals. More prize details will be
                presented to the winner upon confirmation. Winner must have
                participated and earned points in at least one fun/educational
                challenge.
              </p>
              <p>
                Members may only win one trip to the TCO each year. If the
                Cognitive leaderboard winner has already won a trip to TCO
                through other Topcoder competitions, the Cognitive TCO trip
                prize will be offered to the next highest point scorer in line.
              </p>
              <h3>
Tiebreaker
              </h3>
              <p>
                If there is a tie for first place, all tied members will
                compete in a final challenge. This challenge will be
                Cognitive-specific and reviewed to determine the winner, who
                will be awarded the TCO trip.
