You will never be asked to surf a member base, muck through ratings, and ultimately make a decision that you hope is a strong one. On Topcoder TaskForce we first understand your goals and put the right talent in place so you can succeed with ease. Stop playing matchmaker and simply focus on what you want achieved. "

They interface with you, discuss the work, make sure we’re all aligned and then work directly with the paired talent to get this executed for you. It’s like having your very own crowdsourcing concierge and it’s only available on Topcoder."
