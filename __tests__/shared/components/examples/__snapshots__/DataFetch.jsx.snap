    Data Fetch
  </h1>
  <p>
    This is a simple example of how to fetch data from a remote API into the Redux store, using actions and reducers. Two pages available via the links below are implemented with the same code / components, the only difference is that on one route the data are fetched at server side and injected into the page during server-side rendering, thus enhancing page loading time and hence the user experience. At the other route the data are not fetched at the server, thus the code falls back to fetching them at the client-side. Which works fine, but slower.

  <p>
    <a
      href="./data-fetch/server"
    >
      Server-side data fetch.
    </a>
  </p>
  <p>
    <a
      href="./data-fetch/client"
    >
      Client-side data fetch.
    </a>
  </p>
</div>
