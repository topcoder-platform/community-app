    Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML
    <br />
    filters – including 
    <a

    >

    </a>
     – the single biggest source of
    <br />
    inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email.

  <h3>
    Paragraphs and Line Breaks
  </h3>,
  <p>
    A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated
    <br />
    by one or more blank lines. (A blank line is any line that looks like a
    <br />
    blank line – a line containing nothing but spaces or tabs is considered
    <br />
    blank.) Normal paragraphs should not be indented with spaces or tabs.
  </p>,
  <p>
    The implication of the “one or more consecutive lines of text” rule is
    <br />
    that Markdown supports “hard-wrapped” text paragraphs. This differs
    <br />
    significantly from most other text-to-HTML formatters (including Movable
    <br />
    Type’s “Convert Line Breaks” option) which translate every line break
    <br />
    character in a paragraph into a 
    <code>
      <span
        className="hljs-section"
      >
        &lt;br /&gt;
      </span>
    </code>
     tag.
  </p>,
  <p>
    When you 
    <em>
      do
    </em>
     want to insert a 
    <code>
      <span
        className="hljs-section"
      >
        &lt;br /&gt;
      </span>
    </code>
     break tag using Markdown, you
    <br />
    end a line with two or more spaces, then type return.
  </p>,
  <h3>
    Headers
  </h3>,
  <p>
    Markdown supports two styles of headers, [Setext] [1] and [atx] [2].
  </p>,
  <p>
    Optionally, you may “close” atx-style headers. This is purely
    <br />
    cosmetic – you can use this if you think it looks better. The
    <br />
    closing hashes don’t even need to match the number of hashes
    <br />
    used to open the header. (The number of opening hashes
    <br />
    determines the header level.)
  </p>,
  <h3>
    Blockquotes
  </h3>,
  <p>
    Markdown uses email-style 
    <code>
      <span
        className="hljs-meta"
      >
        &gt;
      </span>
    </code>
     characters for blockquoting. If you’re
    <br />
    familiar with quoting passages of text in an email message, then you
    <br />
    know how to create a blockquote in Markdown. It looks best if you hard
    <br />
    wrap the text and put a 
    <code>
      <span
        className="hljs-meta"
      >
        &gt;
      </span>
    </code>
     before every line:
  </p>,
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      This is a blockquote with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
      <br />
      consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus.
      <br />
      Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. Suspendisse
      <br />
      id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.
    </p>
  </blockquote>,
  <p>
    Markdown allows you to be lazy and only put the 
    <code>
      <span
        className="hljs-meta"
      >
        &gt;
      </span>
    </code>
     before the first
    <br />
    line of a hard-wrapped paragraph:
  </p>,
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      This is a blockquote with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
      <br />
      consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus.
      <br />
      Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.
    </p>
  </blockquote>,
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. Suspendisse
      <br />
      id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.
    </p>
  </blockquote>,
  <p>
    Blockquotes can be nested (i.e. a blockquote-in-a-blockquote) by
    <br />
    adding additional levels of 
    <code>
      <span
        className="hljs-meta"
      >
        &gt;
      </span>
    </code>
    :
  </p>,
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      This is the first level of quoting.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        This is nested blockquote.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Back to the first level.
    </p>
  </blockquote>,
  <p>
    Blockquotes can contain other Markdown elements, including headers, lists,
    <br />
    and code blocks:
  </p>,
  <blockquote>
    <h2>
      This is a header.
    </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          This is the first list item.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          This is the second list item.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Here’s some example code:
    </p>
    <code>
      return shell_exec("echo $input | $markdown_script");

    </code>
  </blockquote>,
  <p>
    Any decent text editor should make email-style quoting easy. For
    <br />
    example, with BBEdit, you can make a selection and choose Increase
    <br />
    Quote Level from the Text menu.
  </p>,
  <h3>
    Lists
  </h3>,
  <p>
    Markdown supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists.
  </p>,
  <p>
    Unordered lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens – interchangably
    <br />
    – as list markers:
  </p>,
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Red
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Green
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Blue
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>,
  <p>
    is equivalent to:
  </p>,
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Red
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Green
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Blue
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>,
  <p>
    and:
  </p>,
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Red
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Green
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Blue
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>,
  <p>
    Ordered lists use numbers followed by periods:
  </p>,
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        Bird
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        McHale
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Parish
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>,
  <p>
    It’s important to note that the actual numbers you use to mark the
    <br />
    list have no effect on the HTML output Markdown produces. The HTML
    <br />
    Markdown produces from the above list is:
  </p>,
  <p>
    If you instead wrote the list in Markdown like this:
  </p>,
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        Bird
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        McHale
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Parish
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>,
  <p>
    or even:
  </p>,
  <ol
    start={3}
  >
    <li>
      <p>
        Bird
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        McHale
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Parish
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>,
  <p>
    you’d get the exact same HTML output. The point is, if you want to,
    <br />
    you can use ordinal numbers in your ordered Markdown lists, so that
    <br />
    the numbers in your source match the numbers in your published HTML.
    <br />
    But if you want to be lazy, you don’t have to.
  </p>,
  <p>
    To make lists look nice, you can wrap items with hanging indents:
  </p>,
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
        <br />
        Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi,
        <br />
        viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.
        <br />
        Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>,
  <p>
    But if you want to be lazy, you don’t have to:
  </p>,
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
        <br />
        Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi,
        <br />
        viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.
        <br />
        Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>,
  <p>
    List items may consist of multiple paragraphs. Each subsequent
    <br />
    paragraph in a list item must be indented by either 4 spaces
    <br />
    or one tab:
  </p>,
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor
        <br />
        sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit
        <br />
        mi posuere lectus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet
        <br />
        vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum
        <br />
        sit amet velit.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>,
  <p>
    It looks nice if you indent every line of the subsequent
    <br />
    paragraphs, but here again, Markdown will allow you to be
    <br />
    lazy:
  </p>,
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        This is a list item with two paragraphs.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the second paragraph in the list item. You’re
        <br />
        only required to indent the first line. Lorem ipsum dolor
        <br />
        sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Another item in the same list.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>,
  <p>
    To put a blockquote within a list item, the blockquote’s 
    <code>
      <span
        className="hljs-meta"
      >
        &gt;
      </span>
    </code>
    <br />
    delimiters need to be indented:
  </p>,
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        A list item with a blockquote:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          This is a blockquote
          <br />
          inside a list item.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
  </ul>,
  <p>
    To put a code block within a list item, the code block needs
    <br />
    to be indented 
    <em>
      twice
    </em>
     – 8 spaces or two tabs:
  </p>,
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        A list item with a code block:
      </p>
      <code>
        &lt;code goes here&gt;

      </code>
    </li>
  </ul>,
  <h3>
    Code Blocks
  </h3>,
  <p>
    Pre-formatted code blocks are used for writing about programming or
    <br />
    markup source code. Rather than forming normal paragraphs, the lines
    <br />
    of a code block are interpreted literally. Markdown wraps a code block
    <br />
    in both 
    <code>
      <span
        className="hljs-section"
      >
        &lt;pre&gt;
      </span>
    </code>
     and 
    <code>
      <span
        className="hljs-section"
      >
        &lt;code&gt;
      </span>
    </code>
     tags.
  </p>,
  <p>
    To produce a code block in Markdown, simply indent every line of the
    <br />
    block by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab.
  </p>,
  <p>
    This is a normal paragraph:
  </p>,
  <code>
    This is a code block.

  </code>,
  <p>
    Here is an example of AppleScript:
  </p>,
  <code>
    tell application "Foo"
    beep
end tell

  </code>,
  <p>
    A code block continues until it reaches a line that is not indented
    <br />
    (or the end of the article).
  </p>,
  <p>
    Within a code block, ampersands (
    <code>
      <span
        className="hljs-meta"
      >
        &
      </span>
    </code>
    ) and angle brackets (
    <code>
      &lt;
    </code>
     and 
    <code>
      <span
        className="hljs-meta"
      >
        &gt;
      </span>
    </code>
    )
    <br />
    are automatically converted into HTML entities. This makes it very
    <br />
    easy to include example HTML source code using Markdown – just paste
    <br />
    it and indent it, and Markdown will handle the hassle of encoding the
    <br />
    ampersands and angle brackets. For example, this:
  </p>,
  <code>
    &lt;div class="footer"&gt;
    &copy; 2004 Foo Corporation
&lt;/div&gt;

  </code>,
  <p>
    Regular Markdown syntax is not processed within code blocks. E.g.,
    <br />
    asterisks are just literal asterisks within a code block. This means
    <br />
    it’s also easy to use Markdown to write about Markdown’s own syntax.

  </p>,
  <p>
    In both styles, the link text is delimited by [square brackets].
  </p>,
  <p>
    To create an inline link, use a set of regular parentheses immediately
    <br />
    after the link text’s closing square bracket. Inside the parentheses,
    <br />
    put the URL where you want the link to point, along with an 
    <em>
      optional
    </em>
    <br />
    title for the link, surrounded in quotes. For example:
  </p>,
  <p>
    This is 
    <a
      href="http://example.com/"
    >
      an example
    </a>
     inline link.
  </p>,
  <p>
    <a
      href="http://example.net/"
    >
      This link
    </a>
     has no title attribute.

  <h3>
    Emphasis
  </h3>,
  <p>
    Markdown treats asterisks (
    <code>
      <span
        className="hljs-comment"
      >
        *
      </span>
    </code>

      <span
        className="hljs-literal"
      >
        _
      </span>
    </code>
    ) as indicators of
    <br />
    emphasis. Text wrapped with one 
    <code>
      <span
        className="hljs-comment"
      >
        *
      </span>
    </code>
     or 
    <code>
      <span
        className="hljs-literal"
      >
        _
      </span>
    </code>
     will be wrapped with an
    <br />
    HTML

  <p>
    <em>
      single underscores

  <h3>
    Code
  </h3>,
  <p>
    To indicate a span of code, wrap it with backtick quotes (
    <code>
      \`
    </code>
    ).
    <br />
    Unlike a pre-formatted code block, a code span indicates code within a
    <br />
    normal paragraph. For example:
  </p>,
  <p>
    Use the 
    <code>
      <span
        className="hljs-function"
      >
        <span
          className="hljs-title"
        >
          printf
        </span>
        <span
          className="hljs-params"
        >
          ()
        </span>
      </span>
    </code>
     function.
